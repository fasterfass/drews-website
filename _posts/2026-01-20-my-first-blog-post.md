## Welcome to my 🧠

Hello everyone! 👋 Welcome to my first post! I've been thinking about creating a home for my thoughs for a while now... and now, after a few years of owning the domain [drewfass.com](drewfass.com), it's finally time to use the domain to make that dream a reality. 

This blog doesn't really have any limits or bounds to what posts will be about. It's mainly a landing spot for wherever my attention lies at a given time, and is meant to serve as an archieve for how my thoughts change over time. In a world with so much complexity (growing every day) and so many independent actors (doing more things faster and faster all of the time), I'm pretty confident that even with a consistent lens the way I see the world now will not be the way I see it in 5, 10, 20, 50 years. I want a way to capture that perspecive and codify it, so I can truly reflect back on my experiences without them being fully lost to time.

As for the audience, I'm going to write for my future self. I don't mind if nobody sees it or reads it. I'm not planning to publish it for others to consume. If people find it organically great - if it motivates them great - if it helps lead me to a new career path or can be used to show my past experiences great. But that's not the goal. The goal is purely to get in the practice of not forgetting my realizations and lessons learned over time.

## My Current Dilemma...

As of writing this, I have a ***dilemma***. It's a blessed problem to have but one I don't have the answer to yet. My dilemma is *"what should I do next with my life?"*

This is a big question. Far to big for one blog post. And one that is definitely not going to be answered today (or maybe ever). But I can give some background to my current thoughts and snapshot where my mind is at today.

### Background



Today I feel conflicted between two versions of myself. There

You can write regular paragraphs like this. Use **bold** for emphasis, *italics* for softer emphasis, or `code` for inline code snippets.

### Subheadings

Create structure with different heading levels (H2, H3, H4, etc.).

## Quotes

Use blockquotes to highlight important thoughts:

> This is a blockquote. Perfect for highlighting key takeaways, advice, or memorable quotes from others.

## Lists

### Unordered list:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

### Ordered list:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for code snippets:

```javascript
// Example code block
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby example
def greet(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end
```

## Photos

Add images using this syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text for image](/path/to/image.jpg)
```

Example:
![Example image](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Example+Image)

## Graphics & Embeds

### YouTube Video
```html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" 
  title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; 
  clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

### Twitter Embed
```html
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Tips for Writing Posts

1. **Front Matter**: The `---` section at the top defines metadata:
   - `title`: Post title
   - `date`: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - `categories`: Broad topic areas
   - `tags`: Specific tags for filtering
   - `excerpt`: Short summary shown in post lists

2. **File Naming**: Save as `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug.md`
   - Example: `_posts/2026-01-20-my-first-post.md`

3. **Markdown**: This post uses standard Markdown syntax. See [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

4. **Links**: `[Link text](https://example.com)` or internal: `[About](/about/)`
